# 🧠 Notes: Introduction to Security Frameworks – MITRE ATT&CK

## 🔍 What is MITRE ATT&CK?
- A globally accessible framework that categorizes real-world adversary tactics and techniques.
- Based on documented observations of attacker behavior.

## 🧱 Structure:
- **Tactics:** High-level goals (e.g., Initial Access, Execution, Persistence)
- **Techniques:** How those goals are achieved (e.g., Spearphishing, PowerShell execution)
- **Sub-techniques:** More specific implementations
- **Mitigations:** Ways to defend against each technique
- **Detections:** How to identify these techniques in logs or systems

## 📚 Use Cases:
- Threat hunting
- Red teaming
- Detection engineering
- Incident response

## 🔧 ATT&CK Navigator:
- A visual tool to view and customize ATT&CK matrices for threat modeling.

## 🔗 Common Tactics (Examples):
- Initial Access
- Execution
- Privilege Escalation
- Defense Evasion
- Command and Control
- Exfiltration
