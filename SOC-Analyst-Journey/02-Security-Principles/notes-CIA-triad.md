# üõ°Ô∏è Notes: Understanding Security Principles ‚Äì CIA Triad and Beyond

## üîê CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is a fundamental model in cybersecurity that guides how organizations protect data and systems.

### 1. Confidentiality
- Ensures sensitive data is accessible only to authorized individuals.
- Techniques: Encryption, access controls, VPNs.

### 2. Integrity
- Ensures data is accurate and has not been tampered with.
- Techniques: Hashing, digital signatures, checksums.

### 3. Availability
- Ensures systems and data are available to authorized users when needed.
- Techniques: Backups, DDoS protection, redundant systems.

## üîÑ Additional Security Principles

### Non-Repudiation
- Prevents someone from denying an action they performed.
- Example: Digital signatures in email or transactions.

### Authentication
- Confirms the identity of a user or system.
- Methods: Passwords, OTPs, biometrics, 2FA.

### Authorization
- Determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do.
- Example: Read-only access vs full admin rights.

### Accountability
- Tracks user actions to ensure traceability.
- Tools: Audit logs, user activity reports.
